# Details
This was one of three assignments in my introductory computer graphics course. I was tasked with creating a creative animation that would take advantage of texture mapping in webgl. A high quality export is located in the Movie Submission directory

## Additional Notes
Due to licencing issues, the library used for creating shapes is not included in this upload. Theirfor, you can't run the project propery. I have uploaded a demo on how the project would look like with the missing files.

The model consists of a hierarchy spheres and cubes that were translated using the afine transformations taught in class.
